## Hi — I’m Benyamin Gidanian 👋

Curious developer in Los Angeles who loves building useful software and understanding how things work. I learned to program through Harvard’s CS50 courses and now split my time between **coding (web + AI)**, **learning new toolchains**, and **training** — running and strength work keep me grounded.

### 🧠 How I Work

* **Understand first:** I like breaking systems apart mentally to see how they work.
* **Problem-first:** I enjoy taking large problems and breaking them into actionable steps.
* **Build to learn:** Small, practical tools and experiments teach me more than tutorials.
* **Readable code + docs:** Clear structure, reproducible setup, and useful explanations matter.
