# Hi — I’m Benyamin Gidanian 👋

Curious developer in Los Angeles dedicated to producing efficient, reproducible, and verifiable code. I built my foundation through Harvard’s CS50 and Stanford’s Machine Learning Specialization, and I now split my time between **AI research**, **full-stack development**, and **training** — running and strength work keep me grounded.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

* Applying modular ML systems to real-world integration environments
* Enhancing the performance of reinforcement learning agents
* Building cross-platform experiences with **Flutter**

### 🚀 Selected Projects

* **[ML Fundamentals Library](https://github.com/ben-gid/ml_fundamentals)** — A modular ML library built from scratch using NumPy. Features a custom Deep Learning engine with manual backpropagation and implementations of Linear/Logistic Regression, K-Means, and Decision Trees.

* **[DQN for Autonomous Lunar Landing](https://github.com/ben-gid/LunarLander)** — A Deep Q-Network Agent implemented with TensorFlow/Keras to solve the Gymnasium LunarLander environment. Includes stability mechanisms like Experience Replay and Target Networks.

* **[Social Network Platform](https://github.com/ben-gid/network)** — A full-stack application built with Django and React. Features a RESTful API, scalable database schema, and optimized server-side pagination for post interactions.

* **[AI Crossword Generator](https://github.com/ben-gid/Crossword)** — A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver that generates complex crossword puzzles using backtracking search optimized with AC-3, MRV, and LCV heuristics.

### 🧠 How I Work

* **Understand first:** I like breaking systems apart mentally to see how they work.
* **Problem-first:** I enjoy taking large problems and breaking them into actionable steps.
* **Build to learn:** Small, practical tools and experiments teach me more than tutorials.
* **Readable code + docs:** Clear structure, reproducible setup, and useful explanations matter.
