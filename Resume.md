## Summary 
Analytical Python & ML Developer dedicated to producing efficient, reproducible, and verifiable code. Grounded in a rigorous CS foundation from Harvard and Stanford, I focus on the "how and why" of algorithmic behavior to ensure system reliability. Experienced in developing high-performance ML models using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost and in building traditional full-stack applications with Django and Flutter. Currently focused on bridging the gap between theoretical AI and functional software by creating modular, integration-ready models designed for production environments.

### **TECHNICAL PROJECTS**

**ML Fundamentals Library | Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pytest** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ben-gid/ml_fundamentals)
* **Architected** a modular machine learning library from scratch using **NumPy**, implementing 6+ core algorithms (Linear/Logistic Regression, K-Means, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) without high-level frameworks.
* **Developed** a custom Deep Learning engine featuring manual backpropagation and a Keras-inspired Sequential API for model building.
* **Optimized** mathematical operations through vectorization, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to iterative implementations.
* **Ensured** production-grade code quality by maintaining a 100% pass rate on unit tests (Pytest) and building a custom AST-based documentation generator.

**Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Autonomous Lunar Landing | Reinforcement Learning, TensorFlow, Gymnasium, Python** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ben-gid/LunarLander)
* **Implemented** a DQN Agent from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras** to solve the Gymnasium LunarLander-v3 environment, achieving a "solved" status with a rolling average score of 200+.
* **Engineered** stability mechanisms including **Experience Replay** (using collections.deque) to break temporal correlations and **Target Networks** with Soft Updates (τ=0.001) to prevent model oscillations during training.
* **Optimized** training performance by utilizing **tf.function** decorators for graph-mode execution, significantly reducing per-episode training time.

**Full-Stack Social Networking Platform (Django & React)** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ben-gid/network)
* **Designed** and implemented a scalable relational database schema using **Django ORM**, managing complex many-to-many relationships for user follows and post interactions.
* **Developed** a RESTful API used by a **React** frontend to handle asynchronous data updates (likes, edits) without page reloads, improving UX latency.
* **Engineered** server-side pagination and optimized database queries using **select_related** and **prefetch_related** to ensure performant data retrieval.
* **Implemented** secure user authentication and session management using **Django’s** security framework.

**Crossword Puzzle Generator (AI/Search Optimization) | AI/Search Optimization, Python** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ben-gid/Crossword)
* **Implemented** a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver to automatically generate complex crossword puzzles using Python.
* **Engineered** a backtracking search algorithm optimized with AC-3 (Arc Consistency) to reduce search space by over 80%.
* **Integrated** Heuristics including Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) and Least Constraining Values (LCV) to enhance solver efficiency and handle high-density grids.
